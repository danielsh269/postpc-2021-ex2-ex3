Saying we want to add a cool feature - button "x" to run multiplication.
What code do we need to change/add/remove to support this feature?

we need to add to the calculator logic implementation a method - "insertMult" and change the
logic of the string parsing.
we need to add a button x to the calculator and bind it to the "insertMult" method.

Which tests can we run on the calculator? On the activity? On the app?

now we need to add unit tests that will test that the behavior of the calculator logic works as expected.
we need to add unit tests that will test that the button "x" does its job when pressing on it.
we need to add flow tests what will test the work flow of the application with the multiplication.
